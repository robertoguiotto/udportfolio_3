## Instructions

This app refers to the Website Performance Optimization portfolio project
In order to run the app, you will need to open the file index.html in the dist folder.
From the index.html, follow the Cam's Pizzeria link in order to access the pizza.html file

## Optimization made in the index.html file
The file has undergone the following performance improvements in order to match the Google PageSpeed requirements:
 - image optimization through proper size reduction
 - inlined CSS with grunt-critical plugin
 - solved Google Font issue with WebFont.load script
 - made js asyncronous

## Optimization made in the views/js/main.js file, which is required for the pizza.html file to work

 - fixed the UpdatePosition code. The code optimization involved the measurement of the variables inside the for loops, in order to determine which variables could be moved outside the functions. Furthermore, the querySelectorAll method has been replaced with the more efficient getElementsByClassName.

 - fixed the ChangePizzaSizes code. The code optimization involved the rework of the mentioned function in a "Do Not Repeat Yourself" fashion, and the deletion of the determineDx function.The querySelectorAll method has been replaced with the more efficient getElementsById.

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
